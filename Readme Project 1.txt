Data selection
-In order to successfully accomplish this project, we needed to understand all of the components of Net Asset Value and how to calculate them.
-As result, we needed data which had the closing price of Bitcoin, GBTC, outstanding shares of GBTC, and the total physical holdings of Bitcoin owned by GBTC.
-We leveraged existing data from Yahoo Finance and Greyscaleâ€™s website to complete our data set of price, holdings, outstanding shares.  Once complete, we formatted the files into combined dataframes indexed around time date series.
